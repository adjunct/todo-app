## About

We all write out to-dos some where and then just forget them. At the end, nothing is done. But you can use this **online** to-do list app to store all your to-dos.
Now if you just re-open the site you will have all your to-dos saved there waiting for you to check them.

## Link

## Caution

If you format your disc or you clear the browser data your to-dos will be gone as **localStorage** is used here to save the data.
